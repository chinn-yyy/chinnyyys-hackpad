# Hackpad-
  This is a project that I made following the blueprint "Hackpad" by HackClub and AMD.

  I made this project because I genuinely thought it was cool. I thought it would increase my workflow and also just be fun to make and build. This features 6 MX switches with keycaps "custom designed" and 3D printed with logos on them so I know exactly what I'm clicking. This design also features 2 rotary encoders or knobs. These can be turned and pushed to do anything. Additionally, it has a big, bright, 0.91" OLED display that can be used for anything. Last but not least, I included some LED lights. not only do they look good, they also show exactly what you're clicking.
